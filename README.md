# Comments-spider
An school project which will help you crawl through the topic you are interested in and give you  a list of useful comments.

## Motivation
Since Youtube is a great place for me to learn new skills, I have spent tons of time on it. Not only videos themselves but also comments below are very useful. Many people are discussing about the video, asking questions, providing further more informatoins...... However those comments cannot be searched by the search engine and sometimes there are too many comments to read. So in this project I decide to crawl them out and share them.

## Project plan
I will break tasks into parts:
1. Testing APIs/Document reading.
2. Trying to filter out the informatoin I need.
3. Setup a nice and clean arrangement for users to read.
4. Setup a good user experience.

The Web APIs I will use: Youtube API and Twitter API
For Youtube APIs, I will use the topic/keywords users gave to get a list of videos. And then, I will crawling through the top10 or 20 whatever resaults for the further informations users want to get.

For Twitter APIs, uses can decide to share the reault they got or not. Twitter is a good place to share small stuff, so I choce twitter. Also, if you share the reaults, you are backing up at the same time. You don;t need to search again next time.

## How users will inteact
1. Users have to authrize their twitter account to the applicaton first.(Optional)
2. Two things to input:
(1)The key words/topic you want to search
(2) The question/information you want to search in the comment.(You can type in the whole info or just keywaods.)(I will make as smart as possible.)
3. User will get a list of the comments or information  concerning.
4. Decide to share them or not.
